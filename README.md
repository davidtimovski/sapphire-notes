# 💎 Sapphire Notes

###### Prettier  than Notepad and snappier than Electron alternatives.

## What is it?

A cross-platform desktop application for managing notes built with [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/).

### Features

Create and manage textual notes.

All notes are stored as simple .txt files. So if you decide to stop using the app you'll still have your notes in a format that you can transfer anywhere.

The application saves automatically so you won't ever have to do Ctrl/Command+S (even though you may be compelled to).

By default, the notes are placed in the `%APPDATA%` folder but soon you'll be able to choose the location. This will allow for some interesting use cases. For example, if you want your notes to be backed up you can simply choose to store them in your OneDrive or DropBox folder and voilà, cloud backup! 🌐
