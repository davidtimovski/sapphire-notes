# üíé Sapphire Notes

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/davidtimovski/sapphire-notes/Continuous%20Integration?style=flat-square)

A cross-platform desktop application for managing notes built with [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/). Prettier  than Notepad and snappier than Electron alternatives.

### Features

Create and manage notes.

All of them are stored as simple `.txt` files so if you decide to stop using the app you'll still have your notes in a format you can use anywhere.

The application auto-saves in frequent intervals and also when closed, so you won't have to do Ctrl/Command+S (even though you may be compelled to).

Easily archive notes you're currently not using.

Where the notes are stored is your choice. If you want them to be backed up you can simply choose your OneDrive or DropBox folder as the storage location and voil√†, cloud backup! üåê

There are many hotkeys and actions that can improve your efficiency in using the app. Check them out in the Tips window.
